# Project CovFlu: A Comparative Exploration of Covid-19 and Influenza Demographics in the U.S.

## Executive Summary

Throughout the year 2020, the term Covid19 has certainly become the most familiar term to our ears. If we summarize the whole year with only one word, we surely can use this term. It is astonishing when we think that back in 2019, hardly anyone has ever heard of the term Covid-19 or even knew what a Coronavirus is. Even according to Google Trends, the key phrase Disney Plus was the most searched phrase on Google in 2019 in the United States [1]. When we compare that now with Coronavirus, the latter clearly has the overwhelming edge [2].

Before Covid19 was drastically popularized however, we have been dealing with another virus that was estimated to have taken the lives of 24,000 to 62,000 people between October 2019 and April 2020 season [3]: The Influenza virus, aka the Flu. So we wonder: Are there any overlaps between the groups of population most affected by these two (2) viruses: Covid-19 and Influenza? Our hypothesis is that there are correlations that we can expose between the demographics of these groups of people.

In this project, we analyze the demographics of the population most impacted by these viruses and build a dashboard to present our findings. For this end goal, we will look at available public datasets on Covid-19 and Influenza and draw our findings, conclusions, and recommendations based on our analysis.

## Motivation

As our communities have gotten used to Covid-19 over time, we have started to hear assumptions such as “the expansion of Covid-19 should slow down once we get to the Summer season”, or “Covid-19 is similar the Flu.” 

Clearly, there are assumptions that the Influenza virus and Covid-19 virus share some similarities. Whether these assumptions hold true or not, we want to put them into the test against what the data truly tell us. We want to apply data science-based analysis and good visualizations to draw the right conclusions. For this end, we want to analyze both viruses on the basis of demographic dimensions.

Our goals for this project are to:

-	Analyze the demographics of the population most impacted by Covid-19
-	Analyze the demographics of the population most impacted by Influenza
-	Construct a dashboard that shows the similarities and differences between the subgroup of population most impacted by Covid-19 and Influenza

On a personal note, I am highly interested in the application of Data Science in the Healthcare and Public Health industry. So, it is my personal motivation to analyze this most recent viral outbreak as an applied data science project.

## Data Question

1.	Which subgroups of the U.S. population is the most impacted by the Covid-19 virus?
2.	Which subgroups of the U.S. population is the most impacted by the influenza virus?
3.	How do those two subgroups compare or overlap with each other?

## Anticipated Issues and Challenges

This project presents some couples of anticipated challenges.

1. The sources of the data for Covid-19 are currently disparate yet overwhelming. In order to find the right datasets to use for this analysis, we will have to do a lot of research, cleaning, aggregation, and transformation. Also, related to data source, we do not fully know at this point if all global data on Covid-19 are fully up to date.

In order to address this challenge, we will scope this project to only address the datasets available from U.S. sources for the time being. That is, the scope of this project will be limited to the U.S. A follow-up for this project would be to extend it to include datasets from global sources.

2. The data on Covid-19 is still expanding. As new cases of Covid-19 get discovered every day, the datasets might change as we progress through this project.

In order to address this challenge, we will use static datasets during the development of our application. A follow-up for this project would be to extend it to integrate live data.
