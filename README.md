# Project CovFlu: A Comparative Exploration of Covid-19 and Influenza Demographics in the U.S.

## Background Synopsis

Throughout the year 2020 and beyond, the term *Covid-19* has certainly become the most familiar term to our ears.
It is astonishing when we think that back in 2019, hardly anyone has ever heard of the term *Covid-19* or even knew what a Coronavirus is.

Before *Covid-19* was drastically popularized however, we have been dealing with another deadly virus: The *Influenza* virus.

As our communities have gotten used to Covid-19 over time, we have started to hear assumptions such as *the expansion of Covid-19 should slow down once we get to the Summer season*, or *Covid-19 is similar to the Flu.*
Clearly, there are assumptions that the Influenza virus and Covid-19 virus share some similarities.

We wondered if there are similarities between the groups of population most affected by these two viruses in terms of demographics. And that is how the Project CovFlu was born.

## App Goals

**Our main driving questions that we wanted to answer through analyzing the data were:**

- *Which subgroups of the U.S. population are the most impacted by the Covid-19 virus?*
- *Which subgroups of the U.S. population are the most impacted by the Influenza virus?*
- *How do those two subgroups compare against each other?*

In this Shiny dashboard application, we analyze the demographics of those two subgroups using Covid-19 cases dataset from 2020 and Influenza mortality dataset from 2019. We compare them in terms of the following dimensions:

- Age Groups
- Gender
- Race
- Sickness Cases (Covid-19 Only)
- Hospitalizations (Covid-19 Only)
- Deaths (Covid-19 and Influenza)
